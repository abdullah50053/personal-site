I currently work for DiscoverSTEM, where I am the director of technology as well as a lead innovation facilitator. I have mentored a total of 9 teams (and counting) to innovate solutions to real-world problems, with patents being filed for each of the innovations. Along with facilitating innovation, I am also mentoring a team in designing and developing revolutionary medical devices in the Brain-Computer Interface Lab. Outside of work, I am active in student organizations at UTD. I am most active in the UTD chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, where I am on the organizing team for HackUTD, the largest hackathon in Texas. I am also the project lead for HackPortal, an open-source hackathon management platform used at HackUTD by 1000+ people and companies such as American Airlines, StateFarm, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, and others. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, such as an avionics project to develop an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, as well as running and reading.\n\n\n# Some history\nI used to live in the Bay Area, California before moving to Plano, Texas.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Hiking\n- Aerospace\n- Coding\n- Reading\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(n){return n.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(n){return n.length})).length,h=function(n){var e=Object.assign({},n);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,t.Z)({},e))};e.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Abdullah Hasani",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(r(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
