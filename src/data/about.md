# Intro
Hello!
I am a student studying Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas graduating in Fall 2023. Over summer 2023, I am working at Dell Technologies as a Software Engineering Intern. [In the past, I worked for DiscoverSTEM](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSVEOMPrjxk/) for 2 years as a lead innovation facilitator. There, I led over 15 teams to [innovate solutions to real-world problems](https://discoverstem.info/our-student-innovation/), with patents being filed for most of the innovations. I also led the [Aerospace](https://discoverstem.info/aerospace-tech/) and [Brain-Computer Interface](https://discoverstem.info/neurotech-brain-computer-interface/) Labs, with a [published work on a solution to increase the mobility of fully paralyzed individuals](https://meridian.allenpress.com/innovationsjournals-IDDB/article/2/2022/73/488269/Abstracts-Presented-at-the-2nd-Annual-Advancing). I've also interned at Raytheon over summer 2022 as a machine learning and software development intern. Outside of work, I am active in student organizations at UTD, most notably in the [UTD chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery](https://leadership.acmutd.co/profile/PXjE8XhDE4H1Wv1mKCJ3) where I am on the organizing team for [HackUTD](https://hackutd.co/), the largest hackathon in Texas and third largest in the United States. I also lead the development of [HackPortal](https://github.com/acmutd/hackportal), an open-source hackathon management platform [used at HackUTD](ix.hackutd.co/) by 1000+ people and other organizations and companies all over the United States. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, such as an avionics project to develop an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, as well as traveling, running and reading.
