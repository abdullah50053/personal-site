# Intro
Howdy!
I am a student studying Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. I currently work for DiscoverSTEM, where I am the director of technology as well as a lead innovation facilitator. I have led a total of 9 teams (and counting) to innovate solutions to real-world problems, with patents being filed for each of the innovations. Along with facilitating innovation, I am also leading a team in designing and developing revolutionary medical devices in the Brain-Computer Interface Lab. Outside of work, I am active in student organizations at UTD. I am most active in the UTD chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, where I am on the organizing team for HackUTD, the largest hackathon in Texas. I am also the project lead for HackPortal, an open-source hackathon management platform used at HackUTD by 1000+ people and companies such as American Airlines, StateFarm, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, and others. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, such as an avionics project to develop an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, as well as running and reading.
